        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.OOP is a programming style based on objects, which combine data and behavior (methods) to model real-world things.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and holds actual data and functions defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Abstraction hides the complex details and shows only the important parts.\n",
        "Encapsulation hides the data and protects it from direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction = Hides what’s inside\n",
        "- Encapsulation = Hides the data\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores like __init__, __str__, and __len__.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are used to define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Inheritance in OOP means a class can reuse the code from another class. The child class (also called subclass) gets the properties and methods of the parent class (also called superclass), so you don’t have to write the same code again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, it allows the same method name to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, encapsulation is achieved by hiding data inside a class and allowing access through methods. This protects the data from being changed directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that runs automatically when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object’s data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, both class methods and static methods are used to define methods that don’t work like normal instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class Method:\n",
        "    Defined using @classmethod\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python does not support it directly.\n",
        "* Instead, we use default arguments or *args to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Method overriding means defining a method in a child class that has the same name and parameters as a method in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The child’s method replaces (or \"overrides\") the parent’s version when called.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The @property decorator in Python lets you access a method like an attribute — without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "It is mainly used to control access to private variables (encapsulation), while keeping the syntax clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Polymorphism allows the same method name to work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain, because you can write one function that works with different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be directly used to create objects. It is meant to be a base class and can contain abstract methods — methods that have no body and must be defined in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "You create abstract classes using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.OOP makes programs cleaner, reusable, secure, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.A class variable is shared by all objects of a class and is defined outside methods.\n",
        "An instance variable is unique to each object and is defined inside the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short:\n",
        "\n",
        "-Class variable = same for all objects\n",
        "\n",
        "-Instance variable = different for each object\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class at the same time. This allows the child class to use methods and properties from all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Both __str__ and __repr__ are special (dunder) methods used to define how an object is represented as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "* __str__\n",
        "    Used by print() and str()\n",
        "\n",
        "    Should return a user-friendly string\n",
        "\n",
        "    Meant for readability\n",
        "\n",
        "* __repr__\n",
        "    Used by developers for debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "    Should return a string that looks like a valid Python expression\n",
        "\n",
        "    Meant for accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The super() function is used to call methods from the parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s especially useful in inheritance, where you want to extend the behavior of the parent class without rewriting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The __del__ method in Python is called a destructor. It runs automatically when an object is about to be deleted or destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is usually used to clean up resources like files or network connections before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define special types of methods in a class, but they are different in how they work.\n",
        "\n",
        "* @staticmethod\n",
        "    Doesn’t take self or cls as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Cannot access instance or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Acts like a regular function, just placed inside a class for organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "* @classmethod\n",
        "    Takes cls as the first argument (refers to the class).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Useful when you want to work with the class, not instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, polymorphism with inheritance means that a child class can override a method from the parent class, and Python will automatically call the right version of the method based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows the same method name to work differently for different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable this, each method must return self, which refers to the current object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The __call__ method lets you make an object behave like a function. When defined in a class, you can \"call\" the object using parentheses, and __call__ will be executed.\n",
